A field of computer vision technology labelled object detection detects and identifies items in an image and classifies them into previously established classes. The accuracy and effectiveness of object detection algorithms have been significantly enhanced by recent developments in deep learning techniques [1]. This technological progress has been applied in the large construction industry, where the primary focus has been detecting heavy machinery and workers in outdoor environments.

These applications improve monitoring and optimize operational efficiency in construction sites. Therefore, implementing an object detection model for construction sites, where accidents are frequent, is critical for improving safety measures. The development of such models heavily relies on the availability of high-quality image databases, which are essential for refining and advancing object detection techniques.

It is never the less complex to entirely understand an image, considering the efforts taken toward automated construction site monitoring. Because traditional vision-based monitoring strategies are not scalable to the essential amount of training data needed, they are not sufficient on explanation information for a whole image. These standard methods usually use parametric models, which need difficult and dull parameter integration, to determine objects.  ln addition, these models can often have difficulties make alternations to the wide variety of different circumstances encountered on actual construction sites, thereby lowering their effectiveness and durability. More knowledgeable, scalable solutions that are inclined of taking advantage of deep learning and big datasets to deliver accuracy and efficiency are required to get beyond these limitations. 

Using the YOLO architecture for object detection, our research achieves significant advancements in efficiency and accuracy. YOLO processes high-resolution images at a remarkable real-time of 45 frames per second, out class traditional object recognition methods .By partitioning the images into grid cells, our algorithm enables a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities with exceptional precision.
